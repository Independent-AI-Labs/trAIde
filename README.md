Built for builders. trAIde is a practical TA stack for automated strategies, algo backtesting, research, and dashboards. It combines a tested TypeScript indicator engine, a minimal MCP server (REST + SSE), and a production‑ready React UI. The focus: slash time‑to‑signal and avoid glue work.

Who it’s for
- 🧪 Quant devs and researchers building automated strategies and backtests.
- 👥 Teams needing a reliable indicator core with real‑time streams.
- 🌟 Builders who want a beautiful demo today and a scalable path tomorrow.

Why it’s useful
- 🚀 Faster from idea to insight: history backfill + live SSE ticks for immediate charts.
- 🛡️ No CORS headaches: UI talks to MCP via a same‑origin proxy.
- 🔧 Tooling‑friendly shape: stable endpoints and structured events for integrations.
- ✅ Reliable math: parity with Python ta and high test coverage.

What’s included
- 📦 Core TA engine (TypeScript): broad indicator coverage, fixtures, and utils.
- 🧠 MCP servers: a full MCP (stdio + HTTP + SSE) and a mini HTTP/SSE demo; endpoints include `/health`, `/symbols`, `/klines`, `/indicators`, `/stream/klines`.
- 🎨 React UI: glass minimal hero chart, ChartWorkspace, endpoint control, status/latency, and a same‑origin proxy at `/api/mcp/*`.
- 🧰 Runner CLI: start/stop/status/logs/nuke; port preflight; `.env` support.
- 🐳 Docker: images for UI + MCP with a compose file.

Install
- 📦 `npm install`

Operate (at a glance)
- 🖥️ Use the runner to launch UI and MCP together (defaults: UI 62008, MCP 62007). Root scripts: `npm run dev:start|dev:stop|dev:status`, UI tests: `npm run ui:test`.
- 🔌 Open the UI and, if needed, set your MCP URL via the top‑right “Endpoint” pill; UI talks to MCP through `/api/mcp/*`.
- 🐳 For containerized runs, build with the provided Dockerfiles and use the compose file.

Docker quickstart 🐳
- ▶️ Build and run both services: `docker compose up --build`
- 🔗 UI: `http://localhost:62008` (env `NEXT_PUBLIC_MCP_BASE_URL` points to MCP)
- 🔗 MCP: `http://localhost:62007` with `/health`, `/klines`, `/stream/klines`
- ⚙️ CORS: allow all by default in compose; adjust `MCP_CORS_ORIGINS` as needed.
